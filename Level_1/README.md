## 🧩 Steps Followed to Build the Project

### 1. HTML Structure
- Created a main container to center the card.
- Divided the card into three sections:
  - Profile photo
  - Profile information
  - Social media links

### 2. Center Alignment Using Flexbox
- Used Flexbox on the `body` to center the card both vertically and horizontally.
- Used Flexbox inside the card to align elements in a column.

### 3. Profile Photo Styling
- Applied `border-radius: 50%` to create a circular image.
- Used `object-fit: cover` to maintain aspect ratio.
- Added border and shadow for better visual appearance.

### 4. Font Hierarchy
- **Name**: Larger font size and bold weight
- **Designation**: Medium size with accent color
- **Bio**: Smaller font size, lighter color, increased line height  
- This improves readability and visual hierarchy.

### 5. Spacing and Padding
- Used consistent padding inside the card.
- Used the `gap` property in Flexbox for even spacing.
- Limited bio width to keep text readable.

### 6. Social Media Icons
- Used Font Awesome icons inside anchor (`<a>`) tags.
- Ensured all icons have the same size and circular shape.
- Added hover effects for better interaction.

### 7. Responsive Design
- Added media queries for smaller screens.
- Reduced image size, font size, and icon size for mobile devices.
